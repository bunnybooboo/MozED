      <!-- A-Frame has many shapes it can use. -->
      <!-- This time we will stack these shapes on top each other. -->
      <!-- Just like you might see in Minecraft! -->
      <!-- Instead of picking them up, in this computer code you change the numbers -->
      <!-- Start with the boxes. Move just one of them and try to stack it on top of the other. -->
      <!-- Don't forget to save as you go!! -->
      <a-cone position="-2 1.5 -3" color="green" height="3" radius-bottom"0.7"></a-cone>
      <a-box position="0 0.5 -3" color="brown"></a-box>
      <a-box position="1.5 0.5 -3" color="brown"></a-box>
      <!-- Then finally move the cone shape on top of 2 boxes. -->
      <!-- Could you do it? We provided answers if you need help. Or raise your hand to ask for help!-->
