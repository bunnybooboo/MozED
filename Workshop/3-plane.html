    <!-- Wow!! You are doing an amazing job. -->
    <!-- This is the very last activity! -->
    <!-- In this scene we have added a floor, known as a plane. -->
    <!-- No not like plane in the sky, a carpenter uses a plane to make flat surface. -->
    <!-- "When you fall I'll always be there." said the floor. -->
    <a-scene>
      <!-- Now we are adding a trickster into the mix: rotation. -->
      <!-- What would happen if we did not have that rotation?  -->
      <a-plane position="0 1 -2" rotation="-90 0 0" color="black" height="1" width="1"></a-plane>
      <!-- Add another plane and see if you can get it to look like a wall against the floor. -->
      <!-- This one is real tricky! If you run our of time, don't worry. -->
      <!-- You can try this at home. It's a real challenge! -->
      <a-sky color="beige"></a-sky>
